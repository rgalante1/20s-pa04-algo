# Sequence Searching

## Intro:
How/where to find a particular piece of information in a data set is a very common computer science problem. Thinking of how frequently we search, like, for example, through the use of search engines, it cannot be understated the importance of finding the most efficient methods to perform those searches. A simplified version of this problem, how to effectively search through a large sequence of data, is analyzed in this project.

## Solutions:
Three solutions are implemented: linear, ternary, and binary search. Each solution is tested twice. The first test forces worst case performance by asking for data that does not exist in the data set. The second asks for data in a significantly large list of data, which requires lots of iterations depending on the type of search. The timed results are printed in the generated output file.

## Installation/Running:
Simply clone the repository and run on your local machine/IDE. The timed results can also be viewed in Github Actions.
